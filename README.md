# Time-Series-Analysis of U.S. Housing Market Prices

## Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing and forecasting the trends in U.S. housing market prices from 1963 to 2023. Utilizing time series analysis techniques, the aim is to provide actionable insights into future market behaviors and to assist investors and policymakers in their decision-making processes.

## Methods Used

	•	ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
	•	ARMAX (Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs)
	•	Polynomial Regression Models
	•	Diagnostic Checks and Box-Jenkins Methodology for Model Selection

## Results

The ARIMA(2,2,1) and ARMAX models were explored to enhance forecasting accuracy by incorporating external factors such as economic indicators or related financial series. These models demonstrated strong performance metrics including MAE, MSE, and MAPE, with the ARIMA model achieving less than 5% MAPE. The insights provided offer a reliable basis for understanding and predicting future market dynamics.
